Please translate the following text into English.

The text appears to be a list of tasks or projects related to automotive software development, possibly for a specific engine control unit (ECU).

Here's a breakdown of the likely meaning of each item:

* **Applikation erteilen:** This likely means "Issue application" or "Grant application." It could refer to formally requesting or approving something related to the software development.
* **PS_2.1_011_1666_01 Besondere Merkmale in der Motorsteuergeräte Eigencodeentwicklung bewerten, verfolgen und absichern:** This likely means "Evaluate, track, and secure the proprietary code development for the engine control unit's special features."   
* **Retailoring wegen Änderung Projektrandbedingungen sind notwendig:** This likely means "Retailoring is necessary due to changes in project boundary conditions." Retailoring could refer to modifying the software to adapt to new requirements or constraints.
* **PS_1.6_011_1429_01 Feldfehler abstellen:** This likely means "Correct field errors." Field errors could refer to issues found during testing or deployment of the software in the real world.
* **MSK Auftrag liegt vor:** This likely means "MSK order is available." MSK could refer to a specific department or team responsible for a particular aspect of the project.
* **APS Auftrag liegt vor:** This likely means "APS order is available." APS could refer to another department or team.
* **PS_2.1_011_1687_01 Bestandteile der OBD ASG Homologationsunterlagen erstellen:** This likely means "Create components of the OBD ASG homologation documents." OBD ASG likely refers to a specific standard or regulation for automotive emissions control.  
* **Nachfolgeprozesse (Output):** This likely means "Subsequent processes (Output)."
* **PS_2.1_011_1666_07 Unterfreigaben Motorsteuergeräte - Software inkl. Dokumentation erstellen:** This likely means "Create sub-releases for the engine control unit software including documentation."
* **PS_2.1_011_1666_08 Freigabe der Software und Dokumentation für die Serienproduktion:** This likely means "Release the software and documentation for mass production."




##  Translation and Explanation:

This appears to be a list of tasks and their associated project codes within a software development or automotive engineering context.

Here's a breakdown:

**Tasks (Applikation erteilen):**

* **PS_2.1_011_1666_01:** Evaluate, track, and secure special features in the engine control unit's (ECU) proprietary code.
* **PS_1.6_011_1429_01:** Resolve field errors. (This task is linked to both MSK and APS orders, suggesting it's related to a specific project or issue.)
* **PS_2.1_011_1687_01:** Create components of the OBD ASG homologation documentation.

**Project Codes:**

* **PS_2.1_011_1666_01, PS_1.6_011_1429_01, PS_2.1_011_1687_01:** These codes likely identify specific projects or tasks within a larger system.

**Retailoring:**

* **PS_2.1_011_1666_01:** This task mentions "retailoring" due to changes in project boundary conditions. This suggests that the scope of the project has been modified, requiring adjustments to the ECU code.

**Output (Nachfolgeprozesse):**

* **PS_2.1_011_1666_07:** This code likely represents the output or deliverable resulting from PS_2.1_011_1666_01, which is the creation of sub-releases for the ECU software.


**Overall:**

This snippet provides a glimpse into a complex project involving the development and homologation of engine control unit software.
