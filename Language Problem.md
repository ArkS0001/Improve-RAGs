It sounds like your RAG system is “mixing” German and English documents because the embeddings from your PDF chunks aren’t being clearly separated by language. In other words, the vector space might be too “collided” across languages, so a German query ends up matching an English PDF. Here are a few approaches to address this issue:

• **Separate or tag your documents by language:**  
 – When indexing, detect the language of each PDF (or its chunks) and store that as metadata. Then, during retrieval, filter or re-rank results based on the language tag so that a German query only considers German documents.  
 
• **Use language-specific or fine-tuned models:**  
 – Although many Sentence Transformers are multilingual, some aren’t optimal for every language. Consider using an embedding model that’s been specifically fine-tuned for German (or for cross-lingual tasks). For example, models like “danielheinz/e5-base-sts-en-de” or “intfloat/multilingual-e5-large” have been reported to perform well for German.  
 
• **Apply semantic specialization or normalization tweaks:**  
 – Sometimes general-purpose models exhibit a “textual similarity bias” where superficial (lexical) similarities override deeper semantic differences. Techniques like semantic specialization (e.g. using approaches similar to EMU) or ensuring proper L2 normalization across embeddings can help reduce such collisions.  
 
• **Preprocessing and re-indexing:**  
 – Check that your text extraction and chunking from PDFs preserve language cues. Inconsistent preprocessing might cause documents to “blur together.” Reprocessing with a focus on language integrity can improve the separability in your embedding space.

By combining language metadata filtering with either a dedicated German embedding model or fine-tuning your existing model on German data, you should be able to mitigate these collisions and get more accurate retrieval from your German PDFs.

These steps can help ensure that the retrieval step in your RAG pipeline is more language-aware and that the correct documents are returned for a German query.



How the Code Processes the Query

    Query Language Detection:
        The code calls detect(query) to determine the language of the query. In this case, the query is written in English (even though it names two documents whose contents might be in German). This means that query_lang will be set to "en".
        In the loop that builds the candidate list, the code will only consider sentences whose detected language is either the same as the query (i.e. "en") or marked as "unknown".

    Potential Mismatch:
        If the contents of the PDFs are in German, the majority of the sentence embeddings will have a detected language of "de". Because "de" is not equal to "en", these sentences will be filtered out in the first pass.
        However, the code includes a fallback: if no sentences are found with the language filter enabled, it will retry the search without filtering by language. This ensures that—even if the language of the query doesn’t match the language of the PDF contents—you will still get some results.

    Document Comparison:
        The query itself mentions the two document names, but the code does not perform any special “comparison” logic. Instead, it computes an embedding for the query and retrieves the top matching sentences from the entire corpus (all loaded PDFs).
        Because the document filter (filter_doc) is left empty, the search runs across all documents. If the fallback is triggered (due to language filtering issues), the search will then retrieve sentences from both PDFs (and any others loaded).

    Multilingual Embedding Considerations:
        The embedding model used is "nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe". If this model is cross-lingual (as many SentenceTransformer models are), it might be able to map an English query to German sentences reasonably well. But if it isn’t fully cross-lingual, the mismatch in languages might reduce the quality of the retrieved results.
        In the worst case, if the query remains in English and the fallback is not triggered (because, for example, a few sentences were incorrectly tagged as "en" or "unknown"), the retrieval might be skewed toward any sentences that accidentally passed the language filter. The fallback mechanism helps, but its activation depends on whether the filtered results list is entirely empty.

Conclusion

Will it work?

    Yes, in the sense that the code will run and eventually return results from both documents.
    However, potential issues include:
        Language Mismatch: Since the query is in English but the documents might be in German, the language filter could initially block most sentences, triggering the fallback. This fallback ensures some results, but they may not be as semantically aligned with your intended comparison.
        No Specialized Comparison Logic: The query is treated as a general information retrieval request. It won’t automatically “compare” the documents in a structured way; instead, it will return top matching sentences across the corpus. If you need a detailed side-by-side comparison, you might have to implement additional logic.
        Cross-lingual Performance: The quality of the retrieval depends on whether the embedding model is truly cross-lingual. If it isn’t, you might not get the most relevant matches.
